🔥5 EXERCISES COMPOUND ON 22 DAYS Workout routine for men, Workout From pinterest.com
I never said anything about going exactly 7 times, like i said, if i go every other day, that is 4 days a week.

Train three times per week, but don�t do exactly the same workout every time, as this will soon lead to recovery issues.
