Different ludi (gladiator schools) organized their training regimens differently, however at the time of the roman empire, the most popular organization of training was based on the “tetrad” system developed by the ancient greeks. If you happen to have a couple of gladii (yep, that�s the plural of gladius) lying around, or even if you haven�t but can get hold of a couple of short, hefty sticks, you�ve got yourself a total body workout that will challenge your coordination and teach your body to move in entirely new ways.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
