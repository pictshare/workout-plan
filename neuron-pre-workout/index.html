Exercise can make you smarter, happier and have more neurons depending on the dose (intensity) of the training program. Neuronal processes that connect with different neurons, muscles, and glands (2013) articulates how exercise promotes the growth of neurons in the ventral hippocampus, so people who exercise tend to be able to handle stress better. Neurotransmitter release, if effective, will cause an excitatory post synaptic potential (epsp) and this will ensure that another action potential will commence, and so on, from neuron to neuron.
