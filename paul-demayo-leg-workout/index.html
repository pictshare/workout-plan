<p>The official story is that demayo died of a heroin overdose on june 2nd, 2005. In fact, i may go as far to say that jay, ronnie, kai and dorian�s legs were/are on par with demayo and platz�s, but platz�s and demayo�s legs stand out much more because they overpower their upper bodies so much. While platz�s quads weren’t quite as big as ramy�s, he arguably has the best quads in bodybuilding history when you factor in their symmetry, separation, and proportion to his other leg muscles. Gregg valentino was a close friend of the late bodybuilding champion paul demayo.</p>
