Encourage and Motivate 21 Things to Say to your husband or wife! From encourageyourspouse.com
Workout as something fun to do together, while understanding that it might take some time for her to develop a liking for it. Stationary bikes are great for cardio and they don�t take up a lot of space in your home. The best way to keep the motivation train running is to start gushing a few days following that initial workout. Even if your partner doesn’t like to exercise—or celebrates national doughnut day everyday—steer clear of negative comments.
